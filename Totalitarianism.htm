	<p class="c">Concept first developed in 1920’s by Carl Schmitt as it was mentioned in his work “The Concept of the Political” where the term “totalstaat” was used.
	Giovanni Amendola was the person to put totalitarianism into context by drawing parallels of the word to Italy’s political system of fascism.
	Amendola described its goals as “total representation of the nation and the total guidance of national goals”.
	The use of the term totalitarianism written in the english language was written by Franz Borkenav in his 1938 book “The Communist International”, saying it united Soviet and German dictatorships more than dividing them.</p>
